Dear Internet User:
  To start let me say this, I'm tired of the porn email in my email box and all that click here crap. I'm a published author in the United States, Germany and Japan. I've spend seven hours or more a day for the last two months researching the topic of Spam on the Internet. I've learned a lot about SMTP blocking, reporting Spam, and blocking your email account from being spammed. In this time I have practiced everything I have learned in blocking this crap mail they call professional advertising and in the last few weeks I have not yet received one piece of Spam. I wrote a full report on this process I have developed and did some research on how to get this information around to the right people. I've contacted many spammers and did some price research, what better way to find the Spam haters then to find the spammer that is spamming them. I've talked to many well known bulkers as they like to be called and we made the agreement that I will get to advertise to there list in return for a profit break. I'm forced to sell my report for the reason to pay the advertising fee and keep me alive but on the bright side you will learn to fight against the horrible porn mail in your email box. Please join me in fighting this horrible advertising method that has been on the Internet for years. Remember, "Together we stand, divided we fall."

To order my detailed report and provide your help in fighting spam send $15 to the address below and lets all, together, put a stop to spam once and for all.

The Invisible Killer
Dihydrogen monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Prolonged exposure to its solid form causes severe tissue damage. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance. For those who have become dependent, DHMO withdrawal means certain death.

Dihydrogen monoxide:

is also known as hydroxl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.
contributes to the "greenhouse effect."
may cause severe burns.
contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.
accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.
may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.
has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.
Contamination Is Reaching Epidemic Proportions!
Quantities of dihydrogen monoxide have been found in almost every stream, lake, and reservoir in America today. But the pollution is global, and the contaminant has even been found in Antarctic ice. DHMO has caused millions of dollars of property damage in the US.

Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:

as an industrial solvent and coolant.
in nuclear power plants.
in the production of styrofoam.
as a fire retardant.
in many forms of cruel animal research.
in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products.
Companies dump waste DHMO into rivers and the ocean, and nothing can be done to stop them because this practice is still legal. The impact on wildlife is extreme, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer!
The American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its "importance to the economic health of this nation." In fact, the navy and other military organizations are conducting experiments with DHMO, and designing multi-billion dollar devices to control and utilize it during warfare situations. Hundreds of military research facilities receive tons of it through a highly sophisticated underground distribution network. Many store large quantities for later use.

The Horror Must Be Stopped!

Act NOW to prevent further contamination. Find out more about this dangerous chemical. What you don't know can hurt you and others throughout the world.

VM's note: here is probably some spammer trying to make troubles for a legitimate site, which he's got angry with for some reason.
 

Not so fun: denial of service attack
On a Saturday in March 2000, everyone coming to the department was greeted by colorful notices posted on all doors by our system administrator. They read that the email system is temporarily shut down because of a hacker attack.
We subsequently learned that someone sent out a spam message that appeared to be coming from a non-existent user at our domain name (fysel.ntnu.no). Our server was overloaded by the surge of unsubscription requests (some 16,000 in the next five hours) and had to be shut down. Later, one angry recipient of the spam message emailed everybody at the department, mistakenly shaming us for sending it.
 

Absolutely not fun: Russian spam
I am severely depressed by the contents of Russian spam coming to my mailbox. About half of the messages advertize open, legitimate businesses and educational courses. The latter are often backed by people with academic background and supposedly well known names. I got tired of calling teachers with doctoral degreees and explaining them that spam is bad (I'm writing this in the end of 2002). I'm equally tired of deleting marketing messages that would normally be found only at the purchase department of some industry or a store chain.
Can you imagine a Western research institution or large manufacturer sending spam? There have been Russian ones that did exactly that. Here is one of the best examples (translated from Russian):

Machine factory for sale. Low price.

12 hectare property, 150,000 square feet production floor, 500 machine tools installed.
Large stock of tools and parts. Railway branch line with a bridge crane.
Cheap workforce and good communications available at the location (Western Russia).

(few contact phones in Moscow included)  Febraury 6, 2003
This indicates that theft is still the business norm in my country, and also leaves the impression that the use of Internet in Russia lags the rest of the world by several years. That's it.
Depressingly, this king of spam included requests for donations by some Otrhodox parishes, and offers of church-related services, e.g. does your church want order a bell like this (real image taken from spam, December 2004) from our foundry?

Yet there is some progress (we're not that retarded after all!). In 2004, there appeared 'Nigerian' scam à la russe:

Dear Sir,

I , representing mr. mikhail khodorkovsky (m.k.) would
like to ask
for your
partnership is re-profiling funds over US$18 million.
I will give
the details, but
in summary, the funds are coming via bank menatep,
gibraltar and this
is a legitimate
transaction. You will be paid 4% for your "management
fees".

If you are interested, please write back and I will
provide further
instructions.
Keep this confidential. Finally, please note that this
must be
concluded as quickly
as possbile.

Write me back through my alternate email address on

oleg_maslev@yahoo.fr

I look forward to it.

Mr Oleg Maslev  October 5, 2004
(The Khodorkovsky story apparently worked. I had received improved and expanded versions of it in the following months.)
I received the first “email lottery winner” scam in Russian in March 2005. Unfortunately, I'm yet to read a penis enlargement offer in Russian. This means we are not as advanced yet as the United States population has been years ago. Dammit! :) P.S. April 2006: Yes, we are. Herbal penis enlargement pills, free shipping to any destination in the Russian Federation. At last!
As of summer 2005, spam has become yet another channel for advertising here in Russia. There is no law that limits it.

Another real spam, July 2005: advertising a university in Moscow (one of the less known ones, obviously to boost admission). Dammit.

Some more enlightening Russian spam (hey, do you have that in the U.S.?):

Next weapon in the war: as people start running OCR on images, spammers have started to obscure text in images to thwart OCR, effectively turning the image into a CAPTCHA (in this example, little colored streaks added to the image would result in random errors in character recognition, enough to avoid exact matching of text pattern in spam detection):
